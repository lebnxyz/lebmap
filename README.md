Interactive dialectal-feature map for Lebanese Arabic. Based on the results of
[this survey](https://forms.gle/U4h1xtSJZ5nnv5Ku7) posted to /r/Lebanon on 8/13/19.

Eventually, this will be a proper client-side Lebanon map (populated with real survey data)
that can interactively show real statistics on demand. It'll use d3.js once it gets to that stage.
For now, however, the main focus is just on translating the *survey questions* to a computer-friendly
format, because future computer-friendliness was the least of what was on my mind while I was
making it... and it shows.
