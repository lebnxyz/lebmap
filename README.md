An interactive map charting dialectal features of Lebanese Arabic. Based on the results of
[this survey](https://forms.gle/U4h1xtSJZ5nnv5Ku7) posted to /r/Lebanon on 8/13/19.

This project is starting its second phase, as the survey data's all been normalized and
organized into an easily usable format. The current goal is to create an interactive map
of Lebanon in the browser, complete with clickable response locations and easily accessible
statistical analysis. Hopefully, I can learn to use d3.js in a timely fashion :)
