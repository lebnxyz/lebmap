# lebanese
An interactive map charting dialectal features of Lebanese Arabic. Based on the results of
[this survey](https://forms.gle/U4h1xtSJZ5nnv5Ku7) posted to /r/Lebanon on 8/13/19.

This project is starting its second phase, as the survey data's all been normalized and
organized into an easily usable format. The current goal is to create an interactive map
of Lebanon in the browser, complete with clickable response locations and easily accessible
statistical analysis. Hopefully, I can learn to use d3.js in a timely fashion :)

## The Joke
You already know what The Joke is. We all know what The Joke is. You aren't the first to make The Joke,
nobody was ever the first to make The Joke, The Joke is eternal and undying and came into being nearly
twenty-four whole hours before Time itself, not that we could measure. But it's clearly gotten a little
too comfortable being immortal, feisty thing, so it probably shouldn't be encouraged any more than it's
been already. As such, abstinence from repeating it is much appreciated :)
